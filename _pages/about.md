I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the Unversity of Minnesota (UMN) and I am a member of [Knowledge Computing lab](https://knowledge-computing.github.io/) advised by [prof. Yao-Yi Chiang](https://yaoyichi.github.io/). My research focus on building spatial artifical intelligence and constructing deep learning models on large-set of real-world spatiotemporal data. 

Currently, I am working on multi-modal learning to jointly capturing spatial information (e.g., retrieve useful information from real-world imagery datasets) and forecasting fine-grained data by constructing deep learning-based model to explore spatiotemporal dependences. 

Previously, I received a M.S. degree in Computer Sciecne from the Purdue University Fort Wayne, advised by [prof. Jin Soung Yoo](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~jyoo/). Also, I was a member of [Business Intelligence and Information Management Lab](https://users.pfw.edu/coronado/index.html) advised by [prof. Adolfo Coronado](http://www.coronado.site/).
